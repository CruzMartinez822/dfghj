    <h1>Meet Cruz</h1>
    <p>I'm taking this class because I have always been interested in learning how to code. 
        I thought this would be a good place to start. After the first class I became interested in making a 
    website too.</p>
    <h2>About Cruz</h2>
    <p>I like hanging out with my friends and trying to be active when I can.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <h3>Bike riding</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite things to do is go ride my bike. I just got a new bike for my birthday 
        and I have been enjoying going on rides with my brother. I enjoy riding my bike and it is a healthy 
        way to have fun.

<h3>Movies</h3>
<p>Another hobby I have is going to the movies. My friends and I love going to the movies.
    We try seeing as many new movies as we can. It's a fun way to get together and we always have a good conversation 
    about the movie afterwards. Movies are a fun pass time and for the most part are very enjoyable.

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>My biggest hobby would probably be playing video games. I enjoy playing with my friends, but sometimes 
    I like just playing a solo game. It's a fun way to immerse yourself and take your mind off things. It also is a good way
    to keep in touch with your friends. During Covid me and my friends were able to play a lot together bonding more on games 
    when we couldn't see eachother.
