    <h1>Terraria</h1>

   <img src="images/terraria.jpg" alt="terraria">
    <p>I'm going to be reviewing terraria a popular 2d action adventure game. It is commonly called 
        2d Minecraft but it does some things better, in my opinion they're two different beasts.
    </p>
   <h2>Fun progression</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
<p>Terraria seems really simple when you first look at it. You spawn with copper tools and you have to mine around and explore.
    Then as night comes along you start to fight monsters and as you find hearts bosses will spawn. Then you are delved into 
    a long journey of collecting items and mashing them together to make better items. At a certain point you have a chestfull of swords 
    waiting to be merged into the best sword in the game. 
</p>
    <!--Add an H3 tag about a scene or character, include a quote in the paragraph-->
<h3>The <b>Zenith</b> in <em>Terraria</em> is the final sword you can collect. You will have to do almost everything in the game
to add this to your collection. Then fight the final boss <ins>Cthulhu</ins> a few times to get some swords he can drop.</h3>
